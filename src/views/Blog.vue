    <p><b class="bold-text">Content: </b>
    At first glance of the course syllabus, I was kinda intimated and wondering excatly what did I get myself into. 
    I had an idea that it would be difficult to learn a new skill but i quickly became overwhelmed with all of the 
    different programming languages, databases and other technologies involved in programming. Nevertheless, I 
    decided to just focus on one thing at a time and slowly things start me make sense (after a lot of long nights 
    and being stuck on a single problem for days). Im sure I will get that feeling of intimation again however at 
    least now I know that it does get better.

    <h3><b class="title">Title: </b>Frontend or Backend?</h3><br>
    <p><b class="bold-text">Content: </b>
   Im a few months into the course now and im faced with a question of Frontend (building and designing websites) 
   or Backend (building and designing databases)? To be honest I started this journey with a strong interest in web 
   design and all the cool things you could do, but now I feel like Backend is calling me.(LOL!) I kinda feel like 
   Backend is the heart and brains while Frontend is more like the face but what do I know. I can choose Full Stack 
   which is the main focus of my course which involves both Frontend and Backend,but from my understanding its like 
   a "Jack Of All Trades and Master Of None". AGAIN, what do I know! At some point I guess I will make a decision 
   but until then, the coding journey continues.

    <h3><b class="title">Title: </b>The "Click Affect"</h3><br>
    <p><b class="bold-text">Content: </b>
   Are you wondering what is the "Click Affect"? No worries because as far as I know I completely made it up. It is 
   a way I descibe the time when things FINALLY started to make sense and I could start to see how lines of code 
   worked. Now, please do not misunderstand me I do not fully understand everything but things are clicking and it's 
   exciting. Let's hope that things continue like this and I can one day fully understand it all but until then, the 
   coding journey continues.

    <h3><b class="title">Title: </b>Half-Way</h3><br>
    <p><b class="bold-text">Content: </b>
    At this point I'm half way through my course and lately its been a bit "Up and Down". Some days I feel like I 
    know what I am doing and I have a clear understanding of the lessons. And then the next day I can have a complete 
    brain fart. On those days I just want to throw the laptop at the wall and take a long nap. My wife reminds me that 
    I probably should step away for a moment and do something else to kinda give myself a break. It does help but even 
    then when Im playing with the kids or whatever, I find myself still thinking about the code. Once I was advised to 
    join a FB group or some other chat group where i can be around like-minded people. It was some-what helpful because 
    i did meet a few people but its mostly an exchange of ideas and because im some-what of a newbie, I do not have so 
    much to offer. Oh well I just rambling now, so I will wrap it up but until the next time, the coding journey 
    continues.
