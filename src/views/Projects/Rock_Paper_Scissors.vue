                <h4><b>WHAT THE CODE DOES: </b></h4>
                    <p><u>ROCKPAPERSCISSORS:</u>The code will display a game of RockPaperScissors with the computer 
                    and my code will display the winner or even a tie. This game was written using C# 
                    Console Application using an array, for-loop, and conditional statements. The code allows the 
                    user to input a players name and is then asks if the player is ready to play. Followed by a 
                    countdown. And then its "Game On!". After each round the player is asked if you would like to 
                    continue. If yes the countdown will repeat and if no the app will close with a greeting.
